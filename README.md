# Electronic_Voting_System


This project developed an electronic electoral voting booth for the polling stations that allowed to automate the voting process of the Dominican Republic. The electronic voting booth is able to recognize the identity of the person, validate that this person is entitled to exercise the vote and enable the program that allows to exercise suffrage electronically. Once the vote is cast, this information was kept in the booth and was also sent securely to the Central Electoral Board (JCE). The system made it possible to post and present the final results in the shortest possible time, when electronically recording the results of the votes on the servers of the Central Electoral Board. To provide security in the transfer of information, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) was established between the electronic cabin and the JCE, in addition to the cabin had Ethernet and WiFi connection and likewise, had the ability to alert a designated person if a connection failure occurs by sending SMS messages through the mobile network.
